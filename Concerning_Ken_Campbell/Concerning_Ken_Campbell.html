Ken Campbell was a successful comic actor and entertainer and is the only relative known
to have attained national prominence.&nbsp; He specialised in the &quot;Theatre
of the Absurd&quot;.&nbsp; Ken was the son of Elsie
Campbell <i>n&eacute;e</i> Handley, daughter of Walter
John Handley who was half-brother to my grandfather Arthur
Handley.&nbsp; Hence Elsie Campbell was cousin to Dora and Daisy.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">
Ken was born in 1941 so he was four years younger than me.&nbsp; His mother
Elsie was born in 1905, one year before my own mother Daisy.&nbsp;
It appears that the family lived in Barkingside, Ilford where I
attended secondary school, about two miles from our home.&nbsp; It
seems strange that his family and my own never contacted each-other
over all those years.</font></p>

During the 1970s my mother decided that she would like to meet Ken.&nbsp;
She found the address of his agent at Bromley library, then wrote to
him via the agent.&nbsp; Ken replied with a nice personal
letter.&nbsp; At that time he was living in Stoke Newington, north
London.&nbsp; But they never did meet.&nbsp; My mother lived in
hope that he might appear at the local theatre, but that never happened.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">
Sadly, Ken died suddenly in August 2008 aged 66.&nbsp; He is survived by
his ex-wife, the actress Prunella Gee, and daughter Daisy.</font></p>
