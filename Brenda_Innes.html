        <p>Members may be interested to know more about Major Babbage whose
        influence on the development of Bromley in the late 1870s and '80s was
        covered in &quot;The Town of Bromley a Century Ago&quot;.</p>

        <p>My particular interest in New Bromley stems from having lived there
        for thirty years in a cottage built as a coach house and workshop in 1873
        by Major-General Henry Prevost Babbage.&nbsp; Babbage was typical of the type
        of person settling in Bromley at this time, with adequate if not
        limitless means and a desire for a &quot;rural retreat&quot; within easy
        reach of London.&nbsp; In other ways he was most unusual;&nbsp; Youngest son of
        Charles Babbage, the inventor of the computer, he inherited his father's
        active intelligence and in his years in India had enthusiastically built
        bridges, courthouses, houses and even a bazaar.</p>

        <p>Babbage first mentions New Bromley in his memoirs as the place where
        his younger daughters were at school.&nbsp; Sophie and Mary Babbage are listed
        as &quot;scholars&quot; with Miss Strutt at Denmark Road in the 1871
        census, which also has a Mary Babbage shown as a visitor;&nbsp; this could
        have been their mother, who was always &quot;Min&quot; to her husband.&nbsp;
        On furlough from India later that year he rented Park View House in Park
        Road which was &quot;too small for our family&quot; (at that time
        apparently himself, his wife, three daughters and a maid), but they
        appreciated its over half-acre garden which was &quot;a joy to us
        all&quot;.&nbsp; I believe Park View House was demolished in the 1960s to make
        way for Park Place.

        <p>Later, with his furlough extended by sick leave, Babbage rented
        Komani Villa which he described as being at the corner of Park Road and
        Freelands Road.&nbsp; This being furnished cost him 40 pounds per quarter.&nbsp;
        Komani Villa is a mystery as no house is shown at that spot on the 1862 O.S.
        map, and those on the next edition are largely there today, none of
        which look as if they were built in the early 1870s.</p>

        <p>In 1872 Babbage's father died and his property, which included a
        house called Dainton, was divided among his three sons.&nbsp; Major Babbage
        appears to have invested his share in five acres of land beyond the end
        of Park Avenue which he bought from a Mr. Morum who owned several
        cottages in the area.&nbsp; It was measured up by Mr. Gegeen, the surveyor to
        the local board, on 26 April 1872.&nbsp; This land appears on the 1862 map as
        a gravel pit and brickfield and Babbage describes it as &quot;an ugly
        place where rubbish, etc., was thrown&quot;;&nbsp; rather like a present day
        urban fringe area and probably similarly the result of development.&nbsp;
        In the 1840s a poem had been written to celebrate the removal of stiles by
        Mr. Potts of Freelands, which made the path from Bromley toward his
        house and on to Chislehurst easier for strollers, especially the ladies,
        presumably a pleasant walk across the fields earlier in the 19th
        century.</p>

        <p>Major Babbage's first building on the site was our old 'house', the
        workshop, where he installed those of his father's tools which he
        intended to keep.&nbsp; He records moving them there on 4 September 1872, so
        as he had laid out the foundations on 19 July, this rather plain brick
        building took only a very short time to build.&nbsp; I have always wondered if
        the yellow stock bricks were made on site, but although there were
        certainly bricks being made in Bromley at this time&nbsp; -&nbsp; there were
        complaints about the smoke from the brickworks at Bromley Common&nbsp; -&nbsp;
        I can find no proof of this.</p>

        <p>1873 found Babbage seriously ill, still at Komani Lodge where his
        wife Min nursed him devotedly until May when he took his first airing of
        the year in a Bath chair.&nbsp; No doubt he went to look at the new house,
        Dainton, which was far enough advanced by June for it not to be affected
        by the bankruptcy then of its builder, Mr. Emmett.&nbsp; In August the
        Babbages went to Brighton for a holiday and in September they moved to
        Pengellen House in Anerley.&nbsp; Mrs. Babbage must have had a busy year
        nursing, closing down her father-in-law's house, then furnishing Dainton
        and moving twice.&nbsp; They moved into Dainton later in September.&nbsp;
        I cannot find how many staff they employed though Babbage does mention taking
        Sarah and the maid to Brighton with them.</p>

        <p>Major Babbage then had to return to India for a year to complete his
        25 years' service before retiring with the rank of Major-General, on 14
        December 1874.&nbsp; Once settled in with his family he launched himself into
        local affairs, initially to improve conditions in New Bromley but,
        having gained himself a seat on the Local Board, he involved himself in
        every topic that arose, and his name was scarcely ever absent from the
        columns of the Bromley Record, until he left for Cheltenham in 1885.</p>
