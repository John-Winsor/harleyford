<font size="4" color="#640000">
The name &quot;Babbage&quot; is famous in Victorian history.&nbsp;
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage"><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Charles Babbage</a>
<font color="#640000">M.A. F.R.S. (1791 - 1871) was a mathematician, philosopher,
inventor and mechanical engineer. &nbsp; He is best remembered for originating the concept
of a programmable computer.&nbsp; Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical
computer, the &quot;Babbage Engine&quot;, that eventually led to more complex designs.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#640000">
Charles Babbage's youngest son, Henry Prevost Babbage (1824 - 1918), served in
the private army of the East India Company where he rose to the rank of major-general.&nbsp; 
This army played a notorious role in the suppression of the Indian Mutiny of 1857.&nbsp; 
Henry's autobiography unfortunately implicates him in the subsequent mass executions,&nbsp; 
an event that lead to the effective dissolution of the Company in 1858.&nbsp; 
He also accrued a fortune, ultimately returning to England in 1875.&nbsp; 
During a visit to England in 1872 he purchased a piece of land of about five acres in the district
then known as &quot;New Bromley&quot;.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#640000">Henry built three manor houses of
which two were named Dainton and Harleyford.&nbsp; Henry and his wife lived
in Dainton.&nbsp; I imagine that Harleyford was intended for other members of
his family which comprised three daughters and one son.&nbsp; The third house
named Elsternwick had the address 88 Plaistow Lane.&nbsp; Today this is the
address of the car dealer Ancaster Nissan Bromley.&nbsp; Reference to all the maps
from 1895 to 1971 shows Elsternwick House near to the northern tip of the property.
<img border="0" src="Henry_Babbage.jpg" align="right" width="260" height="367"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#640000">
Adjacent to Dainton, Henry Babbage constructed a coach house and stable.&nbsp; Presumably
he had a horse and carriage.&nbsp; There was also an adjacent blacksmith's forge.&nbsp; 
Today these buildings comprise the ex-coach house residence which is the sole remaining
construction due to Henry Babbage (not forgetting the original boundary wall which extends
from the west of Dainton Close to the west and and north boundaries of the Harleyford estate).
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#640000">Reference to the 1909 map, for
example, shows that the locations of Dainton and Harleyford were carefully
planned.&nbsp; Each house occupies a central position within an approximately
rectangular area, and each area is of similar size.&nbsp; Thus was the boundary
between the Dainton and Harleyford estates established.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#640000">I am curious about the walled-off
areas shown on each of the south west corners of the Dainton and Harleyford
estates.&nbsp; Were these ornamental gardens or, perhaps, kitchen gardens?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#640000">Note that the driveways to both
Dainton and Harleyford end in a loop.&nbsp; This was necessary because of the
difficulty in making a horse and carriage move backwards.</font></p>

<br>
Hereunder I present a chronology of events, true to the best of my knowledge:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#640000">
1872&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Henry Babbage visits England from India and purchases five acres
of land in Bromley.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#640000">
1873&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Henry Babbage has constructed the manor houses Dainton and
Harleyford.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#640000">
1875&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Henry Babbage returns from India to live permanently in England.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#640000">
1885&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Henry Babbage and his family move away from Bromley, but retain
ownership of the property.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#640000">
1906&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Henry Babbage sells the property to W. J. Wilson, Esq.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#640000">
Following 1906 the property has a succession of owners, some with large families.&nbsp; 
Perhaps these owners lived in one of the manors while leasing or renting-out the other.&nbsp; 
The 1933 map shows that another building has been constructed in the south-west corner of the
property.&nbsp; The 1937 map shows that a large building has been constructed in the vicinity 
of Harleyford manor.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#640000"><a name="Return here"></a>
Subsequent to 1937 Dainton manor is demolished and replaced by Dainton
Close.&nbsp; Built in a gracious 1930s architectural style, it has chimney pots
and balconies.&nbsp; The original windows were of leaded-light design, today replicated by
the double glazing.&nbsp; Date of construction?&nbsp; Probably 1938 or 1939.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#640000">Click <a href="Dainton_Close_brochure.html">
<font color="#0000FF"><i>HERE</i></a><font color="#640000"> to see the original tenancy
brochure for the Dainton Close apartments.&nbsp; The rent for a three bedroom flat was
104 pounds per annum inclusive of constant hot water.&nbsp; A garage could be rented for
five shillings per week (25 pence).</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#640000">
Dainton Close compares well with the post-war Harleyford and Bishops Green.&nbsp;
Their stark utilitarian design is mitigated by the spacious grass-and-trees location.&nbsp;
They were probably constructed around 1967.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#640000">
The Harleyford and Bishops Green estates owe their existence to the planning and
foresight of the development company Park Rutland Investments (London) Ltd. who
remain landlord to the present day.&nbsp; Park Rutland created these estates in
1965 by the purchase of <b><i>ten</i></b> separate plots of land.&nbsp; It seems
surprising that they were able to secure the simultaneous cooperation of so many
sellers.&nbsp; Certain of these plots included land that had never belonged to
Henry Babbage.&nbsp; Click <a href="1968_map_back.html"><font size="4" color="#0000FF"><i>HERE</i></a>
<font color="#640000"> to see the 1968 map showing the dispositions of the ten
plots of land.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#640000">All buildings then existent on
this land were demolished.&nbsp; This included the Harleyford manor and three
Victorian houses in Upper Park Road.&nbsp; The last of these houses was larger
than the others and had belonged to the Church of England since the mid-1930s.&nbsp;
There is an unconfirmed rumour that originally it was an almshouse, but later it
became the vicarage for St. John's church in Park Road.&nbsp; I can only guess
that the church connection gave rise to the name &quot;Bishops Green&quot;.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#640000">Park Rutland Investments was incorporated in 1957 so
was not involved in the construction or ownership of Dainton Close.&nbsp;
Neither were they involved in the ownership of the original coach house which
was converted into a residence.</font></p>

<hr width="80%" noshade color="#640000">

<p align="left"><br>
<font size="4" color="#640000"><u>Footnote</u>:&nbsp; Following the death of his
eldest daughter Georgiana in
1884 aged 31 years, 
Henry Babbage and his surviving children moved to Cheltenham in 1885 and lived there until his own death in 1918 aged 94 years.&nbsp;
The provisions of his Will required that his ashes were transported to Bromley to be interred in his freehold vault
in the same space with his late wife Mary.&nbsp; In the other division of the vault his daughter Georgiana is laid.&nbsp; For those who would visit, the vault
is number L2E in London Road Cemetery just a mile from where Henry once lived.<br>
