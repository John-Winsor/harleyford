<p>The name &quot;Babbage&quot; is famous in Victorian history.&nbsp;
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage"><span class="blueit">Charles Babbage</span></a>
M.A. F.R.S. (1791 - 1871) was a mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer.&nbsp;
He is best remembered for originating the concept of a programmable computer.&nbsp; Babbage is credited
with inventing the first mechanical computer, the &quot;Babbage Engine&quot;, that eventually led to
more complex designs.</p>

<p>Charles Babbage's youngest son, Henry Prevost Babbage (1824 - 1918), served in the private army of
the East India Company where he rose to the rank of major-general.&nbsp; This army played a notorious
role in the suppression of the Indian Mutiny of 1857.&nbsp; Henry's autobiography unfortunately
implicates him in the subsequent mass executions,&nbsp; an event that lead to the effective dissolution
of the Company in 1858.&nbsp; He also accrued a fortune, ultimately returning to England in 1875.&nbsp; 
During a visit to England in 1872 he purchased a piece of land of about five acres in the district then
known as &quot;New Bromley&quot;.</p>

<p>Henry built three manor houses of which two were named Dainton and Harleyford.&nbsp; Henry and his
wife lived in Dainton.&nbsp; I imagine that Harleyford was intended for other members of his family which
comprised three daughters and one son.&nbsp; The third house named Elsternwick had the address 88 Plaistow
Lane.&nbsp; Today this is the address of the car dealer Ancaster Nissan Bromley.&nbsp; Reference to all
the maps from 1895 to 1971 shows Elsternwick House near to the northern tip of the property.</p>

<img src="Henry_Babbage.jpg" alt="" align="right" width="260" height="367">

<p>Adjacent to Dainton, Henry Babbage constructed a coach house and stable.&nbsp; Presumably he had a horse
and carriage.&nbsp; There was also an adjacent blacksmith's forge.&nbsp; Today these buildings comprise
the ex-coach house residence which is the sole remaining construction due to Henry Babbage (not forgetting
the original boundary wall which extends from the west of Dainton Close to the west and and north
boundaries of the Harleyford estate).</p>

<p>Reference to the 1909 map, for example, shows that the
locations of Dainton and Harleyford were carefully planned.&nbsp; Each house occupies a central position
within an approximately rectangular area, and each area is of similar size.&nbsp; Thus was the boundary
between the Dainton and Harleyford estates established.</p>

<p>I am curious about the walled-off areas shown on each of
the south west corners of the Dainton and Harleyford estates.&nbsp; Were these ornamental gardens or, perhaps,
kitchen gardens?</p>

<p>Note that the driveways to both Dainton and Harleyford end in a loop.&nbsp; This was necessary because of
the difficulty in making a horse and carriage move backwards.</p><br>

<br>

<p>Hereunder I present a chronology of events, true to the best of my knowledge:</p>

<p>1872&nbsp; &nbsp; Henry Babbage visits England from India and purchases five acres of land in Bromley.</p>


<p>1873&nbsp; &nbsp; Henry Babbage has constructed the manor houses Dainton and Harleyford.</p>

<p>1875&nbsp; &nbsp; Henry Babbage returns from India to live permanently in England.</p>

<p>1885&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Henry Babbage and his family move away from Bromley, but retain ownership of
the property.</p>

<p>1906&nbsp; &nbsp; Henry Babbage sells the property to W. J. Wilson, Esq.</p>

<p>Following 1906 the property has a succession of owners, some with large families.&nbsp; Perhaps these
owners lived in one of the manors while leasing or renting-out the other.&nbsp; The 1933 map shows
that another building has been constructed in the south-west corner of the property.&nbsp; The 1937
map shows that a large building has been constructed in the vicinity of Harleyford manor.</p>

<p>Subsequent to 1937 Dainton manor is demolished and replaced by Dainton Close.&nbsp; Built in a gracious
1930s architectural style, it has chimney pots and balconies.&nbsp; The original windows were of leaded
-light design, today replicated by the double glazing.&nbsp; Date of construction?&nbsp; Probably 1938
or 1939.</p>

<p>Click <a href="Dainton_Close_brochure.html"><span class="blueit"><i>HERE</i></span></a>
to see the original tenancy brochure for the Dainton Close apartments.&nbsp; The rent for a three bedroom
flat was 104 pounds per annum inclusive of constant hot water.&nbsp; A garage could be rented for five
shillings per week (25 pence).</p>

<p>Dainton Close compares well with the post-war Harleyford and Bishops Green.&nbsp; Their stark utilitarian
design is mitigated by the spacious grass-and-trees location.&nbsp; They were probably constructed around
1967.</p>

<p>The Harleyford and Bishops Green estates owe their existence to the planning and foresight of the
development company Park Rutland Investments (London) Ltd. who remain landlord to the present day.&nbsp;
Park Rutland created these estates in 1965 by the purchase of <b><i>ten</i></b> separate plots of land.&nbsp;
It seems surprising that they were able to secure the simultaneous cooperation of so many sellers.&nbsp;
Certain of these plots included land that had never belonged to Henry Babbage.&nbsp; Click 
<a href="1968_map_back.html"><span class="blueit"><i>HERE</i></span></a> to see the 1968 map showing
the dispositions of the ten plots of land.</p>

<p>All buildings then existent on this land were demolished.&nbsp; This included the Harleyford manor and three
Victorian houses in Upper Park Road.&nbsp; The last of these houses was larger than the others and had belonged
to the Church of England since the mid-1930s.&nbsp; There is an unconfirmed rumour that originally it was an
almshouse, but later it became the vicarage for St. John's church in Park Road.&nbsp; I can only guess that the
church connection gave rise to the name &quot;Bishops Green&quot;.</p>

<p>Park Rutland Investments was incorporated in 1957 so was not involved in the construction or ownership of
Dainton Close.&nbsp; Neither were they involved in the ownership of the original coach house which was converted
into a residence.</p>

<p><u>Footnote</u>:&nbsp; Following the death of his eldest daughter Georgiana in 1884 aged 31 years, Henry Babbage
and his surviving children moved to Cheltenham in 1885 and lived there until his own death in 1918 aged 94 years.&nbsp;
The provisions of his Will required that his ashes were transported to Bromley to be interred in his freehold vault
in the same space with his late wife Mary.&nbsp; In the other division of the vault his daughter Georgiana is laid.
&nbsp; For those who would visit, the vault is number L2E in London Road Cemetery just a mile from where Henry once
lived.</p>
