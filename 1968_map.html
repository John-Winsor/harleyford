        <u>A map is a "snapshot" of a moment in history</u>:</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="4">This map was produced by the Borough of
        Bromley in 1968.&nbsp; It shows the new Harleyford and Bishops Green
        estates with the ten plots of land superimposed upon it.&nbsp; These
        plots are marked &quot;1&quot; to &quot;10&quot;.&nbsp; The
        colours were added by myself.&nbsp; The map would explain the reasons
        for the irregular shape of the boundaries of the Harleyford estate.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="4">The purpose of this map was to facilitate
        the imposition of charges upon the new owner Park Rutland Investments
        (London) Ltd.&nbsp; I do not understand the reason for such charges.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="4">Here follows some further information
        concerning the plots of land:&nbsp; The numbers relate to
        corresponding numbers on the map:</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="4"><u>3 (yellow)</u>:<br>
        The Harleyford manor had been located near to the number
        &quot;3&quot;.&nbsp; Otherwise this area provided access to other areas.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="4"><u>2 (orange), 9 (blue) and 10 (pink)</u>:<br>
        The Harleyford apartments are located in these areas.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="4"><u>4 (orange)</u>:<br>
        The Ordnance Survey maps show that a small building was located here
        since 1933 at least.&nbsp; This building was marked &quot;The Cottage&quot; on
        the 1959 and 1966 maps.&nbsp; The area is now occupied by four lockup garages
        associated with the Harleyford estate.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="4"><u>6 (pink) and 7 (green)</u>:<br>
        These areas appear to have been parts of the back gardens of two
        Victorian houses in Plaistow Lane.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="4"><u>8 (light blue/green)</u>:<br>
        In this area was a large Victorian house that had belonged to the Church of England 
        since the mid-1930s.&nbsp; There is an unconfirmed rumour that originally it was an 
        almshouse, but later it became the vicarage for St. John's Church in Park Road.&nbsp; 
        The Bishops Green apartments are partly located here.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="4"><u>1 (green) and 5 (blue)</u>:<br>
        There were two Victorian houses in these areas.&nbsp; The Bishops Green
        apartments are partly located here.</font></p>
