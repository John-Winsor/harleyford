        <div class="font_19px">
        <p>This map was produced by the Borough of Bromley in 1968.&nbsp; It shows the new Harleyford and
        Bishops Green estates with the ten plots of land superimposed upon it.&nbsp; These plots are marked
        &quot;1&quot; to &quot;10&quot;.&nbsp; The colours were added by myself.&nbsp; The map would explain
        the reasons for the irregular shape of the boundaries of the Harleyford estate.</p>

        <p>The purpose of this map was to facilitate the imposition of charges upon the new owner Park Rutland
        Investments (London) Ltd.&nbsp; I do not understand the reason for such charges.</p>

        <p>Here follows some further information concerning the plots of land:&nbsp;
        The numbers relate to corresponding numbers on the map:</p>

        <p><u>3 (yellow)</u>:<br>
        The Harleyford manor had been located near to the number &quot;3&quot;.&nbsp;
        Otherwise this area provided access to other areas.</p>

        <p><u>2 (orange), 9 (blue) and 10 (pink)</u>:<br>
        The Harleyford apartments are located in these areas.</p>

        <p><u>4 (orange)</u>:<br>
        The Ordnance Survey maps show that a small building was located here since 1933 at least.&nbsp;
        This building was marked &quot;The Cottage&quot; on the 1959 and 1966 maps.&nbsp;
        The area is now occupied by four lockup garages associated with the Harleyford estate.</p>

        <p><u>6 (pink) and 7 (green)</u>:<br>
        These areas appear to have been parts of the back gardens of two Victorian houses in Plaistow Lane.</p>
        
        <p><u>8 (light blue/green)</u>:<br>
        In this area was a large Victorian house that had belonged to the Church of England since the mid-1930s.&nbsp;
        There is an unconfirmed rumour that originally it was an almshouse, but later it became the vicarage for St.
        John's Church in Park Road.&nbsp; The Bishops Green apartments are partly located here.</p>

        <p><u>1 (green) and 5 (blue)</u>:<br>
        There were two Victorian houses in these areas.&nbsp; The Bishops Green apartments are partly located here.</p>
