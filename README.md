Harleyford is the name of the apartment estate in Bromley (a suburb of London UK) where I live.  It was constructed on the site of three mansions built in Victorian times by Henry Prevost Babbage (1824 = 1918), youngest son of Charles Babbage who invented the first mechanical calculator.  Henry served in the private army of the East India Company where he rose to the rank of major-general.

This army played a notorious role in the suppression of the Indian Mutiny of 1857.  Henry's autobiography unfortunately implicates him in the subsequent mass
executions, an event that lead to the effective dissolution of the Company in 1858.  He also accrued a fortune, ultimately returning to England in 1875.  During a
visit to England in 1872 he purchased a piece of land of about five acres in the district then known as "New Bromley".
