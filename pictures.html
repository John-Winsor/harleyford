<p>The superb picture of the Dainton and Harleyford manor houses was painted by Henry Babbage's brother Herschel.&nbsp;
Henry Babbage and his family lived in Dainton.&nbsp; It was named after a house in Devon owned by his father, Charles
Babbage.</p>

<p>Adjacent to Dainton is shown a group of small buildings which would include the coach house and stable, later to
become converted into a residence.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Herschel_Babbage"><span style="color:#0000ff;">
Benjamin Herschel Babbage</span></a> (1815 - 1878) was the eldest child of Charles and Georgiana Babbage.&nbsp;
Herschel's life was even more successful than that of Henry.&nbsp; He has an extensive entry in the on-line
encyclopaedia Wikipedia (whereas Henry is mentioned only in association with his father's mechanical computer).</p>

<p>In 1851 Herschel sailed to South Australia where he lived for the remainder of his life.&nbsp; He went there to conduct a
geological survey on behalf of the colonial government.&nbsp; It was our good fortune that he took his painting with him.&nbsp;
Ultimately the painting was donated to the State Library of South Australia in Adelaide where it remains today.&nbsp;
Its image has been transmitted back to England by email in the form of a high resolution graphic.</p>
