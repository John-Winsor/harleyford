The superb picture of the Dainton and Harleyford manor houses was painted by
Henry Babbage's brother Herschel.&nbsp; Henry Babbage and his family lived in
Dainton.&nbsp; It was named after a house in Devon owned by his father, Charles
Babbage.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#640000">Adjacent to Dainton is shown a
group of small buildings which would include the coach house and stable, later
to become converted into a residence.</font></p>

<font size="4" color="#0000FF">Benjamin Herschel Babbage</a><font color="#640000">
(1815 - 1878) was the eldest child of Charles and Georgiana Babbage.&nbsp;
Herschel's life was even more successful than that of Henry.&nbsp; He has
an extensive entry in the on-line encyclopaedia Wikipedia (whereas Henry is
mentioned only in association with his father's mechanical computer).</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#640000">In 1851 Herschel sailed to South
Australia where he lived for the remainder of his life.&nbsp; He went there to
conduct a geological survey on behalf of the colonial government.&nbsp; It was
our good fortune that he took his painting with him.&nbsp; Ultimately the
painting was donated to the State Library of South Australia in Adelaide where
it remains today.&nbsp; Its image has been transmitted back to England by email
in the form of a high resolution graphic.</font></p>
